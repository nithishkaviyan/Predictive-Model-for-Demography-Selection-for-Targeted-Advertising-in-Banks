# Predictive-Model-for-Demography-Selection-for-Targeted-Advertising-in-Banks

This repository contains an ipython notebook file for the predictive model developed to predict if a customer with given features will subscribe to term deposit or not.

The predictive models used were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (both with Ridge Regularization), Ensemble Methods such as Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting, and 5-layer Neural Network (Multi-layer Perceptron Network).

Since the data is heavily imbalanced (with only 10% of the values being positive), different evaluation metrics (k-fold Cross Validation, ROC curve) were used to evaluate the performance of the model.

The repository also contains an ipython notebook file containing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the data using plotly and a Tableau Workbook which contains additional Data Visualizations
